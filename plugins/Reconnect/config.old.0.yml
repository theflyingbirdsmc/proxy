# Reconnect --- config file
# In this file, you can setup some basic settings for the plugin.

# The current version of this configuration. Do NOT change this value!
# If the plugin uses a more recent config version, this config gets replaced by it
#   while a backup of the old config will be kept as "config.old.ver.<OLD VERSION>.yml".
version: 15

# Should debugging messages be shown?
debug: false

# This is for configuring custom animations.
Animations:
  # This is the placeholder of the animation. 
  # It will be replaced with the correct animation when it is found in a value that supports animations
  "%dots%":
    # At what frequency should the animation play
    # 1000 = 1 change per second
    # Minimum value is update-rate
    Delay Millis: 1000
    # The animation itself
    # You may use the %playerName% placeholder in animations
    Animation:
    - "&b.&7.."
    - "&7.&b.&7."
    - "&7..&b.&7"

# This value should not be changed unless you are experiencing issues with titles "flickering" on bedrock clients
# In which case you should change this value to 1 second (1000)
# Minimum value is 50 Maximum value is 5000
update-rate: 50

# The default locale used for user messages when the users' locale is undefined
default-locale: "en_US"

# Titles, subtitles and actionbar messages are configured in the ./plugins/lang/ folder

# The amount of milliseconds the plugin will wait before attempting to check if the server is alive.
# This must be at least 500, however if you use an automatic restart plugin that kicks players
#   reconnect may actually reconnect them before the server stops accepting new connections. This may cause unstable behavior.
# Recommended value is 8000
delay-before-trying: 8000

# The amount of milliseconds the plugin will wait between each new connection attempt per player - per server.
# Depending on server size and hardware having 20+ people reconnect at once can cause issues in the game, plugins and or databases.
# if your server ends up hanging when people are reconnecting this (can) be an indicator that this value is too low
#   or that the hardware your server is running on is too weak and or that the plugins/server are badly optimized.
#   Also be sure to see connect-finalization-timeout
# Recommended value is 1000
delay-between-reconnects: 1000

# How much MORE time between reconnects should we wait for a connection to finalize.
# A connection is considered "finalized" once the server sends a dimension to the client.
# This "can" help in preventing server overloads before allowing another reconnect attempt.
# However you should still set delay-between-reconnects to a reasonable value in-case of plugins sending
#   dimension changes to the client and or to issues (see above)
# Recommended value is 2000
connect-finalization-timeout: 2000

# The amount of milliseconds the plugin will wait for the proxy-server connection to establish, before it decides to try again. 
# Note: If a connection is not finalized within this timeframe another attempt will be made.
# Any reconnect that times out will be chucked back at the start of the reconnect queue.
# Cannot be less then 2000 + connect-finalization-timeout
# Recommended value is 6000
reconnect-timeout: 6000

# The maximum amount of time the plugin will wait to connect everyone.
# If this time limit is reached the plugin will first attempt to connect them to your fallback-server otherwise kicking them.
# This value cannot be less than delay-before-trying + reconnect-timeout.
# The default value is 240000 (240 seconds) if your server takes longer to restart and connect everyone set this higher.
# be mindful to set this value high enough to also accommodate for delay-between-reconnects.

  # When regex is set to true, the regex must match the kick message if the player should be reconnected to that server.
  # Leaving the text empty will lead the plugin to always reconnect the players, no matter what the actual kick-reason was.

  # You can still use the "ServerReconnectEvent" as a plugin developer to decide on your own whether the user should be reconnected automatically
  # or not.
